# Project 03 — Deepfake Detection Pipeline

A computer vision pipeline that detects manipulated faces.  
The workflow includes:

- Face extraction and normalization  
- Training a CNN/ViT model  
- Evaluating precision, recall, and false-positive rates  
- Running inference via a lightweight script
